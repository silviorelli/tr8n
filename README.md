# Welcome to Tr8n Translation Engine

Tr8n Translation Engine is a Rails Engine Plugin/Gem that provides a platform for crowd-sourced translations of your Rails application.
The power of the engine comes from its simple and friendly user interface that allows site users as well as professional translators to rapidly 
translate the site into hundreds of languages. 

The rules engine that powers Tr8n allows translators to indicate whether sentences depend on gender rules, numeric rules or combinations of rules configured for each language.
The language specific context rules and language cases can be registered and managed in the administrative user interface. The engine
provides a set of powerful tools that allow admins to configure any aspect of the engine; enabling and disabling its features
and monitoring translation progress.

The Tr8n engine is based on a robust and flexible pluggable architecture where rule types and the syntax of the TML tokens
can be configured or extended for any application deployment.

Tr8n translation engine has been successfully deployed by Geni and Yammer:

Geni Inc, http://www.geni.com

You can visit their web sites and see how it is being used.
